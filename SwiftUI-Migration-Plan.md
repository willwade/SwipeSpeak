## ☁️ CloudKit Migration Strategy (Zephyr Replacement)

### Current Problem: Zephyr Concurrency Issues
**Issue**: Zephyr library causes Swift 6 concurrency crashes when UserPreferences is marked with `@MainActor`
- Zephyr uses KVO observers that dispatch to background queues
- Swift 6 strict concurrency checking conflicts with Zephyr's queue management
- Crashes occur when tapping prediction cells due to UserDefaults observation

### Modern Solution: Native CloudKit Integration

#### 1. CloudKit Data Model Design
```swift
// User Preferences Record
CKRecord(recordType: "UserPreferences") {
    keyboardLayout: String
    announceLettersCount: Bool
    vibrate: Bool
    audioFeedback: Bool
    speechRate: Double
    speechVolume: Double
    voiceIdentifier: String?
    predictionEngineType: String
}

// Custom Words Record
CKRecord(recordType: "CustomWord") {
    word: String
    frequency: Int
    dateAdded: Date
    userRating: Int
}

// Sentence History Record
CKRecord(recordType: "SentenceHistory") {
    sentence: String
    dateCreated: Date
    frequency: Int
}
```

#### 2. CloudKitSyncManager Implementation
```swift
@MainActor
class CloudKitSyncManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var syncStatus: SyncStatus = .idle
    @Published var lastSyncDate: Date?
    @Published var isCloudAvailable: Bool = false

    private let container = CKContainer.default()
    private let database: CKDatabase

    // Modern async/await CloudKit operations
    func syncUserPreferences() async throws
    func syncCustomWords() async throws
    func handleConflictResolution() async throws
}
```

#### 3. Swift 6 Concurrency Compliance
- Use `async/await` for all CloudKit operations
- Proper `@MainActor` isolation for UI updates
- `nonisolated` methods for background sync operations
- Structured concurrency with `TaskGroup` for batch operations

#### 4. Migration Benefits
- **Swift 6 Compatible**: No concurrency conflicts
- **Modern APIs**: CloudKit's latest async/await patterns
- **Better Error Handling**: Structured error types and recovery
- **Improved Performance**: Batch operations and efficient syncing
- **Enhanced Security**: CloudKit's built-in encryption and privacy
- **Reduced Dependencies**: Remove third-party Zephyr dependency

#### 5. Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Remove Zephyr, implement basic CloudKitSyncManager
- **Week 2**: Add user preferences sync with conflict resolution
- **Week 3**: Implement custom words and sentence history sync
- **Week 4**: SwiftUI integration, testing, and polish

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Continuous Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Maintain 85%+ coverage throughout migration
- **Integration Tests**: Verify component interactions
- **UI Tests**: Automated testing of user workflows
- **Accessibility Tests**: VoiceOver and assistive technology validation
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark against baseline metrics

### Testing Tools

- **SwiftUITestUtilities**: Custom testing helpers ✅ **Implemented**
- **Accessibility Testing**: VoiceOver compliance validation ✅ **Implemented**

- **Progress**: Critical Runtime Issues Partially Resolved + CloudKit Migration Strategy Added
  - 🚨 **CRITICAL FIX**: Zephyr concurrency crash resolved (temporarily disabled Zephyr)
    - **Issue**: Swift 6 concurrency conflict between @MainActor UserPreferences and Zephyr's background queue operations
    - **Root Cause**: Zephyr KVO observers calling `zephyrQueue.async` from @MainActor context causing crashes when tapping prediction cells
    - **Temporary Fix**: Disabled Zephyr initialization and monitoring to prevent crashes
    - **Impact**: App now launches and runs without crashing, but iCloud sync temporarily disabled

  - 📋 **IDENTIFIED REMAINING ISSUES** (Current Active Problems):
    1. **Missing text on keyboard buttons**: SwiftUI KeyView not displaying letters/text - buttons appear blank
    2. **Keyboard height issues**: Not expanding to full height, white empty space above/below keyboard area
    3. **Prediction cell display**: Not full width/height, UIKit elements showing through SwiftUI components
    4. **Layout integration**: SwiftUI components not properly filling allocated container space
    5. **App launch failure**: App builds successfully but fails to launch in simulator (empty UI hierarchy)

  - 🔍 **TECHNICAL ROOT CAUSES**:
    - **KeyView text rendering**: SwiftUI Text() components not displaying key.text values
    - **Container constraints**: UIHostingController not properly sized to fill keyboardContainerView
    - **Z-index conflicts**: UIKit views still visible underneath SwiftUI overlay
    - **Prediction binding**: SwiftUI PredictionLabelsView not receiving data from MainTVC prediction engine
    - **Launch issues**: Possible main thread blocking or initialization order problems

    3. Implement CloudKit migration to replace Zephyr permanently
    4. Complete UI integration fixes for production readiness

### 2025-06-22 - SwiftUI Migration UI Issues Investigation & Fixes ⚠️
- **Status**: Phase 1 - 100% Complete, Phase 2 - 100% Complete, Phase 3 - 100% Complete, Phase 4 - 75% Complete
- **Progress**: SwiftUI Migration UI Issues Partially Resolved
  - ✅ **FIXED**: Tutorial dialog disabled for testing (added DEBUG flag in AppDelegate)
  - ✅ **FIXED**: SwiftUI keyboard touch events working (key taps detected and processed)
  - ✅ **FIXED**: Dual UIKit/SwiftUI keyboard setup resolved (removed conflicting UIKit keyboard)
  - ✅ **FIXED**: KeyboardViewModel prediction system simplified (MainTVC now handles all predictions)
  - ✅ **FIXED**: Text display placeholder fields hidden (sentencePlaceholderTF, wordPlaceholderTF)
  - ✅ **WORKING**: Complete key input flow verified with debug logging
    - KeyView detects tap/swipe gestures ✅
    - KeyboardView processes input ✅
    - KeyboardViewModel updates enteredKeys ✅
    - MainTVC receives updates via Combine binding ✅
    - MainTVC runs prediction engine ✅
    - MainTVC updates word display ✅
    - KeyboardViewModel gets updated with results ✅

  - ⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUES** (Not Fixed - Documented for Future Work):
    1. **Predictions Not Updating Visually**: While prediction engine runs and finds 7 predictions, they're not visible in UI
    2. **Large Red Box Around Keyboard**: UIKit keyboard container still showing red border despite SwiftUI keyboard
    3. **Text Display Area Not Expanding**: SwiftUI text display not filling full allocated space in top area
    4. **UIKit Views Still Visible**: Original UIKit elements showing underneath SwiftUI components
    5. **Settings Button Navigation**: Still navigating to old UIKit settings instead of SwiftUI SettingsView

  - 🔧 **Technical Notes**:
    - SwiftUI keyboard architecture working correctly (logs show full input processing)
    - Issue appears to be visual/layout related rather than functional
    - MainTVC prediction engine generating results but UI not reflecting changes
    - Hybrid UIKit/SwiftUI integration needs further refinement
    - Container view sizing and z-index issues need investigation
